               Selection: used for decisions, branching -- choosing between 2 or more alternative paths. 
               In C++, these are the types of selection statements:
               if
               if/else
               switch
               Repetition: used for looping, i.e. repeating a piece of code multiple times in a row. 
               In C++, there are three types of loops:
               while
               do/while
               for
             */

            //
        }
    }
}
